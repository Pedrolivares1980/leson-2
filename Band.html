    <h1>HEROES DEL SILENCIO</h1>
        <p>Héroes del Silencio (sometimes abbreviated Héroes or by their initials HDS) was a Spanish<br>
        rock band based in Zaragoza, initially formed by Juan Valdivia (lead guitar) <br>
        and Enrique Bunbury (vocals and rhythm guitar), and completed with Joaquín Cardiel (bass) <br>
        and Pedro Andreu (drums), in the mid-1980s. They experienced great success in Spain and Latin America,<br>
        as well as in several European countries, including Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, France and Italy,<br>
        becoming one of the most successful groups in the history of rock in Spanish.<br>
        After twelve years in which they sold more than six million records in more than thirty-seven countries,<br>
        and played more than a thousand concerts, the band split up in 1996.</p>

    <h3>Most Important Albums</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>TOUR 2007</dt>
          <dd>It is my favourite album. After ten years of their separation, they started a tour<br>
            of 12 concerts between Mexico, Argentina, Guatemala, USA, and Spain. The tour was known as<br>
            the farewell tour, as the band split up without saying goodbye. It is my favourite, because it was<br>
            the only live performance of the band that I have ever experienced, and every time I listen to it<br>
            I can feel and remember all the emotions of that wonderful night. </dd>
        <dt>AVALANCHA</dt>
          <dd>My favourite album, one of the first important live performances of the band in Madrid,<br>
            where you can appreciate the quality of their live show.</dd>
        <dt>PARASIEMPRE</dt>
          <dd>Last live performance of the band recorded in Germany, just before the beginning of their first<br>
            and only tour in the United States.</dd>
