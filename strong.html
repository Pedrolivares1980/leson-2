    <h1>Site Map</h1>
    <p>A diagram of the organization of a website is called a <em>site map</em>.
        A <em>site map</em> represents the structure, or organization, of pages in
        a website in a visual manner. Creating the site map is one of the
        initial steps in developing a website.
